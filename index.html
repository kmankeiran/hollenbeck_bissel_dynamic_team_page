		<p class="loganText">Hi there, My name is Logan Bissell and I am currently enrolled in Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. I am 18 turning 19 in october and I am the younger brother in my family. My passion falls into video editing and I am hoping to move towards being a part of the movie industry post graduation. In my spare time I like to play video games, explore new movies and tv shows, and play some of my instruments (acoustic guitar and electric keyboard). My main goal with whatever full time position I end up in, is to be able to bring the same happiness to people that movies have brought to me in my life.</p>
